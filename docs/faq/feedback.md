## smart-doc Test Case Feedback
Some `bugs` have emerged. It's hard for the official team to replicate issues reported with just a few lines of code pasted in a simple `issue`. In such cases, it's necessary to provide a code example that can replicate the issue. Below is how to provide test cases to the official team.

## Single Module Test Case
If the issue can be replicated in a single module, the steps for submitting a test case are as follows:
- `Fork` the [smart-doc-example-cn](https://github.com/smart-doc-group/smart-doc-example-cn) project into your personal repository;
- Modify the `forked` code to add a test case. Then, on the project's `GitHub`, there will be a `&#8203;``【oaicite:1】``&#8203;` option. Choose to submit a PR to us. The official team will also merge the test case to test the problem.

## Multi-Module Project Test Case Feedback
If the issue can only be replicated in a multi-module context, the steps for submitting a test case are as follows:
- `Fork` the [spring-boot-maven-multiple-module](https://gitee.com/smart-doc-team/spring-boot-maven-multiple-module) project into your personal repository;
- Modify the `forked` code to add a test case. Then, on the project's `Gitee`, there will be a `&#8203;``【oaicite:0】``&#8203;` option. Choose to submit a PR to us. The official team will also merge the test case to test the problem.
